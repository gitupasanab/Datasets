# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, outliers)
2. Data visualization (histograms, correlation heatmaps, boxplots)
3. Feature engineering (new features created, transformations applied)
# Machine Learning Models
Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, RMSE
Best Performing Model: Logistic Regression
